      <h1 id="Introduction">Comp 15 Code Style Guide<br><br>
        How to write clear, concise, and modular C++ for Comp 15</h1><br>
    <div class="quote">"A computer language . . . is a novel formal
    medium for expressing ideas about methodology, not just a way to
    get a computer to perform operations. Programs are written for
    people to read, and only incidentally for machines to
    execute."</div><br>
    <div class="author">-- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 
    Harold Abelson, Gerald J. Sussman, Julie Sussman</div><br><br>

    <div class="par">A program is a written description of your
    approach to solving a problem. It is a description that a computer
    can execute, but human readers are the target audience for whom
    you write. The compiler doesn't care about your variable names,
    code formatting, or comments-- it chews on what's underneath.
    People, on the other hand, rely on all those things, 
    and you want them to understand and have confidence in your solution! 
    Therefore, endeavor to write clear, concise, modular code.</div>
    
    <div class="par">All code you submit will be graded for structure
    and organization (including readability) as well as for
    functionality. Formatting matters. When you submit your work, it
    should be beautiful, and there should be no question of your
    dedication and correctness. Prepare it as if you were writing up
    an example for a good textbook. You wouldn't use a book that had
    no chapters, figures, captions, section headings, paragraph
    breaks, etc. Similarly, no one wants to read unorganized,
    undocumented code with huge functions and 500-character
    lines.</div>
    <div class="par">Just as with a paper for a literature course, the
    first draft of a program that works is not usually the version to
    submit. We allocate points of your homework/project grades for
    code that meets the criteria for readability. For example, we
    expect that you will clearly and consistently indent your code and
    adhere to an 80 column limit. We will also grade your internal
    documentation.</div>
    <div class="par">This document contains requirements (and also hints) for
    how to write programs that others, including the graders, will find easy to 
    read. No document can be complete, and if you ever have questions about 
    what is readable and what is not, please come see us!</div>
    <div class="par">Furthermore, although some of these style
    guidelines are specific to our course and others would not be
    applicable to all programming languages, writing readable, concise
    code is an extremely valuable skill that is important to practice
    early in your CS career; it will benefit you forever. No matter for
    whom you're writing your code, they will appreciate being able
    to read it without difficulty.</div>
    <div class="par">Finally, this style guide is written for Comp 15 students, 
    and refers to key Comp 15 concepts. Therefore, it's important to 
    continually refer back to this style guide as you progress through the 
    course and gain a better understanding of the ideas that will contextualize
    these guidelines. Check it before each homework, and you'll see your code-
    writing skills (and grade) soar.</div>

    <div class="section" id="InternalDocumentation">Internal Documentation 
    (Comments)</div>

    <div class="par">Internal documentation comes mainly in the form
    of comments, and is crucial to having easy-to-understand
    code. Ideally, it would allow a reader with little to no prior
    knowledge of C++ to understand the gist of what is happening in
    your code, and why. For this reason, much of your internal
    documentation will focus on the <span class="ital">whys</span> of
    your program — how does a given section of code contribute
    to the overall functionality of your program? This kind of
    documentation is important to include at many levels, from the
    README that describes your project as a whole, to the files that
    make up your program, to the individual functions you write, and
    even down to short but potentially confusing snippets of
    code.</div><br>

    <div>There are two options for when to comment your code:</div><br>

    <ol>
        <li>Before writing your code. Use comments (potentially combined with 
        pseudo-code) to plan what you're going to write. As you write your 
        code, update the comments to reflect changes in your plan.</li>
        <li>As you write your code. Describe what you're doing in whatever 
        piece of code you're currently writing. As your code becomes more 
        complete, you can edit and potentially remove comments.</li>
    </ol><br>

    <div class="par">Writing your comments after finishing your code is 
    not an option! If you show code to a member of the course staff, it is 
    acceptable for them to say "I can't read this code without documentation. 
    I'll help someone else while you work on that. Let me know when the 
    documentation is complete."</div>
    <div class="par">The most important part of commenting is that the 
    comments and code are in-sync with each other. Regardless of when you 
    choose to write your comments, give them a once-over before submitting
    them to make sure that they still accurately represent your implementation.
    We have pondered for hours why code seemed to be different from what the
    comments said, only to conclude eventually that the code was 
    <span class="ital">unintentionally</span> different 
    from what the comments said. Then we had to find out which (if either!)
    was correct for the problem. 
    Confidence in the code goes down after this.</div>

    <div class="subsection" id="FileHeaderComments">File Header Comments</div>

    <div class="par">File header comments go at the top of each file.
    They must include some straightforward but important information
    — your name, the date, and the assignment title. When you
    edit a provided file that already has an author's name in it, you
    should add "Edited by" and then your name underneath the original
    author's name.</div>
    <div class="par">Another thing we look for in file headers is the purpose 
    of the file. Most notably, this should <span class="ital">not</span> be 
    something we can deduce from the file name!</div>
    <div class="par">Header comments should also include any known bugs or 
    "to do" items.  For example,  "Currently only supports sophomores.  
    TODO:  support students of other years."</div>
    <div class="par">For this course, you will often write your own classes, 
    with one .h file and one .cpp file for each class. If your class were 
    called "MyList," for example, then you would have a MyList.h and a 
    MyList.cpp. One thing we often see when grading file header comments is, 
    for example, MyList.h having the stated purpose 
    "This is the header file for the MyList class." This is  not helpful! 
    Because we are already in agreement on the file naming scheme used in 
    our course, we already know before opening the file that it is a 
    header file for a class named MyList.</div>
    <div class="par">Instead, write thorough, detailed descriptions of 
    your files that keep potential users of your code in mind.
    Here are some things to consider that will help you write
    informative file purposes comments:</div><br>

    <ul>
        <li>When a user opens your <span class="bol">driver file</span> (the file that contains <span class="code">main()</span>),
 they are probably wondering: What does this program do as a whole? What
 purpose does it serve? Is it a good fit for what I need to accomplish?</li>
        <li>When a user opens a <span class="bol">header (.h) file</span>,
 they probably have noticed that it is a class header and are wondering:
 What is this class? What role does it play in the overall program? How 
does it interact with the other classes? What needs are best met by this
 class? They may be deciding whether to repurpose the class you wrote 
for a completely different program or, conversely, whether to use the 
rest of your program but replace that class with something else.</li>
        <li>For each class, the comments should describe what instances of the class represent and what the <span class="ital">abstract state</span>
 of an instance is.  For example: "StudentList is a class that 
represents an ordered list of Student instances.  Every new StudentList 
begins empty, and clients can then add and remove Students from the 
list."  You may go on to define the main <span class="ital">behaviors</span>
 (public functions) or you may document those functions as they are 
declared, but the overall purpose/intended uses of the class should be 
documented at the top. If there are limitations, document them: "This 
class only handles lists of length 100 or less."</li>
        <li>It is never the purpose of a class to "contain nodes." That 
is an implementation detail that clients don't care about. 
Implementation-specific information should go in the private section of 
the class and/or in the implementation.cpp file.</li>
        <li>When a user opens a <span class="bol">.cpp file</span> for a
 class, it is probably because they have decided to use your class, 
either in your program or a program of their own, and have run into some
 confusion regarding how it works. They are probably wondering: What's 
the best way to instantiate and then use this class? How do I accomplish
 the purposes laid out in the header file? Is there some bug still in 
this class I should know about? Is there some weird quirk or subtlety in
 the way this class is meant to be used?</li>
    </ul><br>

    <div class="par">Keeping an imaginary user in mind will allow you to write 
    helpful, non-obvious descriptions of your files, even for relatively 
    straightforward programs and classes.</div>
    <div class="par"><span class="bol">A Note:</span> 
    This will be reiterated below in the section on README files, 
    but it is important to remember here that code's purpose is 
    <span class="ital">never</span> determined by its implementation details!
    When deciding <span class="ital">whether</span> to use a program or class,
    people care about whether it will accomplish their goals, not 
    <span class="ital">how</span> it will accomplish those goals.</div>

    <div class="subsection" id="FunctionContracts">Function Contracts</div>

    <div class="par">Function contracts appear just before the function 
    header and are meant to explain how the function fits into the larger 
    program. They must include the function's purpose, any parameters, 
    any return values, and any other information that might affect the rest
    of the program. A function contract should not include 
    implementation details, nor should it include information that can
    be found in the function prototype.</div><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Purpose should say what the function
        does, <span class="bol">not</span> how the function does
        it. Often this takes the form of answering how does this
        function fit into the larger program. It should not include
        any implementation details.  E.&nbsp;g., a function's purpose
        might be "To update the table so it maps the given key to the
        given value.  The previous value associated with that key, if
        any, is lost."</li>
        <li>Parameters should include information about what they 
represent in the function and larger program. This section should also 
include any restrictions or expectations on what will be passed as a 
parameter.
            <ul>
                <li>This section should not include information that can
 be gleaned from the function prototype: saying "two ints and a string" 
is unhelpful.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Return value (if the function is non-void). "Return the
        number of distinct items in the table" or "Return the first
        item in the list greater than or equal to the given
        value."</li>
        <li>Other information: This section should include side
        effects caused by the function. For example, in
        removeFromBack(), a list would change size (decrease in size
        by one). Input and output would be considered side effects,
        too.  Other information in this section might be memory
        management that occurs or needs to occur as a result of the
        function running, any exit or failure conditions that would
        cause the program to halt or the function to throw an
        exception, or identified or suspected bugs within the function
        ("this function does not work for __ reason" or
        "I <span class="ital">think</span> this function is causing my
        program to __").</li>
    </ul><br>

    <div class="subsection" id="InlineComments">In-line Comments</div>

    <div>Include:</div><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Bugs. If you have identified a bug to a specific line of 
your program, make a note. Graders are more understanding of documented 
bugs versus bugs they have to suss out. At least, it shows you know it's
 there. </li>
        <li>Confusion. If there's an unclear or complicated section of 
your code, something that would not be obvious to someone with 
experience coding, explain it.</li>
        <li>Cases. If you are writing the code to deal with a specific 
case that's relevant to key invariants of the data structure, you should
 identify the relevance of the invariant.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div>Don't Include (in your submission):</div><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Questions: In-line comments asking questions about the code 
or what should be done ("Do I need to increment this here?", "I don't 
know if this works") are not helpful and should not be in submitted 
code. Those kinds of questions can and should be addressed in office 
hours.</li>
        <li>Outdated TODOs: Comments that indicate things that need to 
be written and/or fixed are useful while you are working, but the things
 you TO-DID should not still say TODO. If a part of your implementation 
is missing, a TODO comment is helpful as an acknowledgement.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <div class="par">Commented-out code should <span class="bol">
        <span class="ital">not</span></span> be submitted! 
        It's great to test out multiple potential solutions to a problem, 
        but by the time you submit, you should have chosen the code that 
        works the best and deleted anything you decided not to use. 
        The occasional (but notable) exception to this rule is 
        unit testing code that is meant to crash your program.</div>

    <div class="subsection" id="README">The README</div>

    <div class="par">A README is a file used to describe a program. 
    Every open source project has a README file that describes what is 
    going on in a program, what is necessary for it to work properly etc. 
    In this course, it additionally will answer questions related to the 
    topics/data structures covered in the assignment. 
    The first thing someone opens when they look at a project is the README. 
    When we are grading, that is the first file we open and the place 
    we will go if we have questions or confusion about the code. 
    It is crucial to fill it out thoroughly and in detail.</div><br>
    <div>README files contain some straightforward, 
    but important information:</div><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Your name, the date, the assignment title, and the course (Comp 15)</li>
        <li>How to compile and run your program</li>
        <li>Acknowledgements of any help you received — TAs you
        sought help from in office hours, peers you vented about your
        coding struggles with (without showing them your code, of
        course!), snippets of code from lecture or the course website
        you used as inspiration, online resources you found helpful
        (including our class' forum), etc. Even if an assignment was
        particularly easy for you and you didn't receive help from any
        of these sources, this section should not be left blank. You
        could instead list one obvious source of information, such as
        the professor's lecture on a relevant topic.</li>
        <li>Any bugs still in your program that you were unable to fix, and where they can be found in the code</li>
        <li>Data structures section for you to describe the data structures used in the assignemnt</li>
        <li>Sometimes the spec will include questions that should be 
answered in your README. It's worth noting here that those tend to be a 
significant portion of your grade.</li>
        <li>Time spent section for you to note how many hours you spent on a particular assignemnt</li>
    </ul><br>

    <div>There are also parts of the README that are a little less straightforward:</div><br>

    <ul>
        <li>You should describe the purpose of your program. This can 
and should be done in three sentences or less, but it's important to 
think hard about what information would be useful to a potential user of
 your program. Namely, <span class="ital">the implementation details of a program are irrelevant to its purpose.</span>
 When I was deciding between Atom, VSCode, Vim, Emacs, and Sublime, I 
considered the features of each editor and how effectively each one 
suited my needs. I did not wonder about the underlying implementation 
details of each editor at all.</li>
        <li>You should describe each file you have submitted. Guidance 
for describing source code files can be found above, in the section on 
file headers. Other files you might submit, which will have simpler 
descriptions, are the README (which can be described by just saying 
"this file"), unit testing source code files, and sample inputs that you
 used for testing. It's important to list <span class="ital">every</span>
 file you submitted, even if the description is obvious! For example, if
 one of your files is mistakenly left out of your submission, having it 
listed in the README will help the TA understand what happened and 
remedy that.</li>
        <li>You should describe, chronologically and in detail, how you 
tested and debugged your program as you were working on it. In this 
course, you will be required to unit test <span class="ital">every</span>
 program you write. Unit testing is necessarily something you do as you 
write your code, so the full process is not always perfectly visible 
from the final files you submit. This is your chance to convince the 
grader that you thoughtfully and thoroughly tested your program as you 
were writing it. Include, for example, information about how you 
isolated and tested particularly tricky functions, and describe bugs you
 found while unit testing and how you fixed those, or edge cases that 
came up through your testing. If you tested as you wrote code and 
documented your ideas throughout the assignment, this step should be 
trivial.</li>
        <li>Last but not least, seeing as this is a Data Structures 
course, you should describe the data structures you used in your 
program! <span class="ital"><span class="bol">This is your chance to explain the implementation details of your program.</span></span>
 What data structures did you practice writing this week? How do they 
work? What are their advantages and disadvantages? Similarly, if you 
learned and practiced implementing a new algorithm, briefly explain how 
it works. Write as if this section is meant to be read by somebody who 
has only taken an introductory computer science course, but is really 
interested in learning about the concepts from our course.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section" id="CodeItself">The Code Itself</div>

    <div class="subsection" id="Organization">Organization into Classes and Structs (Data Structures!)</div>

    <ul>
        <li>If a struct is meant to be used in a class, it should be
        defined inside of that class. If it is used internally to the
        class, it should be private.  For example, a Node struct used
        inside a linked list should be private.  If a struct needs to
        be declared outside of any other class for whatever reason, it
        should be declared in its own header file.</li>
        <li>Non-interface functions in a class should be declared
        private. The only functions that should be public are the ones
          required for the client to be able to use the class. </li>
        <li> All data members should be declared private.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection" id="Recursion">Recursion</div>

    <ul>
        <li>Recursive functions should only be concerned with the <span class="ital">current</span> element. Avoid dereferencing "<span class="code">next</span>" or children pointers in the function body; rather, just recurse to the next or child node.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection" id="Variables">Variables</div>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="bol">No global variables:</span> no variables
        should be declared or defined outside of functions with the
        exception of global constants.</li>
        <li>Use of literals should be avoided; use global (or static)
        constants instead. If your program calls for an 8x8
        two-dimensional array, for example, create a global
        constant <span class="code">ARRY_SIZE = 8</span>, then declare
        your array with <span class="code">int[ARRY_SIZE][ARRY_SIZE]</span>
        rather than <span class="code">int[8][8]</span>.</li>
        <li>Variable names should be descriptive, with the exceptions
        of variables with very limited scope: i and j for loops
        (triple-nested loops should not
        occur); <span class="code">curr_&lt;type&gt;</span>
        (e.g. <span class="code">curr_node</span>) as a
        pointer; <span class="code">temp</span>
        or <span class="code">aux</span>
        for <span class="ital">very</span> temporary variables
        (accessed by 3 lines of code or fewer). One appropriate use
        for <span class="code">temp</span> would be swapping two
        elements in an array, for example. <span class="code">Foo,
        var,</span> and <span class="code">x</span> are not
        descriptive variable names and should never be used.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection" id="Brevity">Brevity</div>

    <ul>
        <li>Use boolean expressions and values. For example, there is no reason to write<br>
            <span class="code"><span class="indent">if (isBig == true)</span></span><br>
            <span>when you can write</span><br>
            <span class="code"><span class="indent">if (isBig)</span></span>
        </li>
        <li>Don't write functions longer than 30 lines between the opening and closing brace. This will affect your modularity grade.</li>
        <li>Do not rewrite code that is given to you, create functions 
with nearly identical uses, or write in-place code when there is a 
function you can call to do the same work.</li>
        <li>Use helper functions to simplify code, especially if they 
can be called in many places. But a helper function can also be useful 
if it provides a name for a computation that makes other code clearer. 
For example, rather than test<br>
            <span class="code"><span class="indent">if (front == nullptr) </span></span><br>
            <span>all the time, you can define a function called </span><br>
            <span class="code"><span class="indent">if (isEmpty())</span></span>
        </li>
        <li>Try to avoid doing unnecessary work. For example, rather 
than recomputing something several times, compute it once and save it in
 a well-named variable.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection" id="Whitespace">Whitespace</div>

    <ul>
        <li>Indentations should be made up of either 4 or 8 spaces, not 
tab characters (with the important exception of makefiles. If you don't 
understand why a Makefile must contain tabs, ask a TA). Tabs display 
differently based on a computer's settings, but spaces always look the 
same. Most text editors have a setting to output a specified number of 
spaces instead of a tab character whenever you press the "tab" key.</li>
            <li class="doubleList">Furthermore, indentation should be 
consistent! Indentation is a crucial part of code's readability, as it 
helps readers understand how code fits together. Make sure the levels of
 indentation accurately reflect which function or code block(s) any 
given line is part of.</li>
            <li class="doubleList"><span class="ital">In our course, the width of your indentation should be either 4 or 8 spaces.</span>
 Indentation of only two spaces makes your code more difficult for us to
 read. If this causes you to struggle to adhere to the 80 column rule, 
then your code has too many levels of nesting, and needs to be more 
concise, more modular, or both.</li>
        <li>Binary operators (operators that take two pieces of input, such as '+', '*', '=', and '=='') should have spaces around them.</li>
        <li>Unary operators (operators that take only one piece of input, such as '++'') should <span class="ital">not</span> have spaces around them.</li>

        <li>When declaring pointers, the asterisk should be attached
        to the variable name, <span class="ital">not</span> the type
        (<span class="code">Node&nbsp;*curr</span> rather than
          <span class="code" style="text-decoration: line-through;">Node*&nbsp;curr</span>).<br>
          Rationale:  The compiler interprets the <span class="code">*</span> as a
          decoration of the variable name on its right, not part of
          the type:  <span class="code" style="text-decoration:
          line-through;">Node*&nbsp;np1,&nbsp;np2;</span> declares one
          pointer variable and one variable that contains a
          <span class="code">Node</span>, which is confusing.
          Putting the <span class="code">*</span> next to the
          variable it modifies makes it clear to the reader which
          variables, if any, hold pointer values:
          <span class="code">Node&nbsp;*np1,&nbsp;np2;</span>.  
          (<span class="code">np2</span> is poorly named, but its
          status in the declaration is clear.)
        </li>

        <li>In lists declaring and initializing variables, there should be a space after every comma.</li>
        <li>There should be a single space between a loop or conditional
 keyword (such as for, if, and while) and its corresponding opening 
parenthesis, but no space between the name of a function and its 
corresponding opening parenthesis.</li>
        <li>This should go without saying, but do not violate any of 
these guidelines in order to make your code adhere to the 30 line or 80 
column rules. This will make your code difficult for the grader to read,
 and therefore will not help your score.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subsection" id="OtherGuidelines">Other Guidelines</div>

    <ul>
        <li>No line should be longer than 80 characters. In other words, no files that you wrote should have more than 80 columns. Typing "<span class="code">wc -L *</span>" into the terminal will display the number of columns in each file in your current folder.</li>
        <li>There are some style rules that pertain to conditional statements and loops, as well. These determine the <span class="ital">control flow</span>
 of your program, so having easy-to-read conditional statements and 
loops is immensely important to a reader's ability to understand what is
 happening in your code.</li>
            <li class="doubleList">Use the keywords "<span class="code">and</span>," "<span class="code">or</span>," and "<span class="code">not</span>" as opposed to the equivalent operators "<span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>," "<span class="code">||</span>," and "<span class="code">!</span>" so your code is both easier to read and less prone to difficult-to-spot bugs caused by typos. (Note: You should use "<span class="code">!=</span>"" when checking for inequality)</li>
            <li class="doubleList">Don't treat non-boolean variables
            as booleans — we know that when a number is 0 or
            pointer is null, it will evaluate to false. For
            readability, however, you should explicitly compare the
            variable to zero.  For example,
            write <span class="code">while (n &gt; 0)</span> rather
            than <span class="code">while (n)</span>(Sorry, 
            Python programmers.)</li>
            <li class="doubleList">The <span class="code">break</span>
            keyword should only be used when you have
            a <span class="code">switch</span> statement. In addition
            to making loops more difficult for a reader to understand,
            it undermines one objective of our course, which is to
            learn to write code (including loop conditions)
            thoughtfully.</li>
            <li class="doubleList">Returning from inside of a loop,
            however, is often useful and
            encouraged. The <span class="code">continue</span> keyword
            may be used occasionally, but should be avoided when
            possible.</li>
        <li> Curly braces.  We are somewhat flexible on this, but be
        consistent, but here are some notes:
          <ul>
            <li> If an open curly brace (<span class="code">{</span>) is placed at the end of a line of code,
              there should be a space before it to separate it from
              what came before.  It may also be placed on the next
              line lined up under the beginning of the statement it's
              part of.
            </li><li> Close curly braces (<span class="code">}</span>)
              should be on a line by themselves unless the statement
              they are part of continues.  For example, you may write
              "<span class="code">}&nbsp;else&nbsp;{</span>" all on
              one line (or you can put each item on its own line).
            </li><li> We do not require the use of curly braces for blocks
              of a single statement.  That is, you may write
              an <span class="code">if</span> statement or
              a <span class="code">for</span> loop without any curly
              braces if the body is one line long.  However, as a
              rule, do not put an entire <span class="code">if</span> statement on one line.
          </li></ul>
        </li><li>The keyword <span class="code">auto</span>
        should <span clas="ital">only</span> be used when declaring
        variables of the <span class="code">iterator</span> type. This
        is a Data Structures course — you're expected to develop
        a very strong grasp of which class, struct, or primitive data
        type you are working with at any given time.</li>
        <li>When working with pointers, the
        keyword <span class="code">nullptr</span> is preferable to the
        old-fashioned, C-style
        constant <span class="code">NULL</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="ital">[EDIT: Added Jan - 27 - 2022]</span>
        Finally, we gently recommend against using <span class="code">
        this-&gt;</span> to refer to a class' members from inside of one of its
        functions. Points will not be taken off for doing so, but
        students should know that it is typically unnecessary.</li>
    </ul>


<!--    
    <div class="section" id="Evaluate">How We Evaluate</div>

    <div class="par">When we grade functionality of your code, one
    thing we do is to use automated tests and compare your output to
    the output we expect. If your results differ from ours on multiple
    tests, we try to fix bugs that may have caused multiple tests to
    fail, and will refund points for tests that failed due to a
    "cascading error" &mdash; basically, we won't deduct points for
    the same bug twice. HOWEVER, this process breaks when we spend an
    hour looking at your code and cannot find a bug that we know must
    exist. It takes way longer for us to do this debugging process if
    we can't read your code. If you have readable, well documented
    code, it is much more likely that you will get points back for
    these errors, which often amounts to a difference of multiple
    letter grades.</div>
    <div class="par">This is another reason it is especially important to 
    document wherever bugs occur in your code &mdash; any time we save by 
    not having to find the bug ourselves, we can spend fixing the bug and 
    then giving you back those cascading error points.</div>
    -->
    <p>
    </p><div class="par">Finally, our parting word of advice is to always give 
    your code a quick once-over immediately before submitting.
    Maybe there are function contracts or file headers that are no longer 
    relevant; maybe you forgot to document something as you were writing; 
    or maybe there is a particularly complicated function that you will 
    realize needs better in-line commenting. Documentation and Style points 
    are, in many ways, the easiest points to earn on any given comp 15 
    assignment — whether or not you have time to get your code 
    working perfectly (or at all) before the due date, you can always get
    full points for this section. Don't let yourself miss out on what 
    should be very reliable credit just because something 
    slipped your mind!</div>
