                The FAQ page has questions from previous semesters that can help
                you if you are stuck, or have a general question. Spec specific
                questions will still be answered over Piazza. Questions are
                asked by students or written by TAs and answered by the teaching
                staff.

                        You have NUL characters ('\0') in your source code.
                        Usually that's hard to do. I can think of a couple ways
                        this can happen, one of which is a big problem. <br>
                        <br>It's possible you actually have some NUL
                        characters in your source code. That can happen through
                        copy/paste (boo, hiss!), through a deliberate effort to
                        put them there (unlikely if you're surprised and/or
                        unhappy about it), or because you were editing a file
                        over a flakey internet and they got inserted by a noisy
                        connection (very unlikely in modern times). <br>
                        <br>If this is the case, which, alas, I expect is
                        unlikely, then open the file in an editor and remove
                        them. Some editors may not show them, which makes it
                        hard, but the error messages are telling you exactly
                        where they are, e. g., on line 85, columns 1, 2, 3, 4.
                        NUL characters will show up as ^@ in Emacs and some
                        other editors, because Ctrl-@ is a way to type them.
                        <br>My fear is that you may have destroyed your .cpp
                        file by storing compiler or linker output there. This
                        can happen if you separate the -o flag from the it's
                        other half --- the file name for the output.
                        <div class="terminal">
                            clang++ -Wall -Wextra -o foo foo.cpp
                        </div>
                        will compile and link the file foo.cpp and save output
                        into foo (-o foo)
                        <div class="terminal">
                            clang++ -Wall -Wextra -o foo.cpp foo.cpp
                        </div>
                        will compile and link the file foo.cpp and store the
                        resulting executable file back in foo.cpp. This will
                        destroy the contents of foo.cpp and replace it with
                        binary data. If this happened to you, then the file is
                        lost. You may be able to recover an earlier version by
                        looking for editor backup files (files that end in ~ for
                        Emacs and some other editors). If you have the file in
                        an editor somewhere, then you can re-save what you have,
                        and you may not have lost much if anything. If you've
                        been storing your files on the department servers, then
                        log in, go to the directory in question, and then "cd
                        .snapshot" which will show you the available back-ups of
                        the directory. <br><br>The backup system takes a
                        snapshot of files about every 4 hours or so. Find the
                        most recent backup that isn't binary junk (look the
                        files from newest to oldest), and then copy that backed
                        up file out to the directory. You will have lost work,
                        but hopefully not too much. <br>
                        <br>
                        Otherwise, you may have to start over. The good news (if
                        there is any) is that writing stuff the second time is
                        much easier, since you solved all the problems already
                        very recently.

                        The space column says how much space you're using. The
                        limit column is a hard upper limit on your disk usage.
                        Try to exceed this limit causes "fatal error: error in
                        backend: IO failure on output stream: Disk quota
                        exceeded". If you just want to find and get rid of large
                        files, the command:

                        You can then narrow down which files/folders take up a
                        lot of space in your directory. If you absolutely can't
                        figure out what's taking up space, shoot an email to
                        quota@eecs.tufts.edu and ask them if they can increase
                        your disk quota (you have to give them a number) and
                        tell them why. In a pinch, often you can delete .o files
                        from previous semesters / old folders, which can free a
                        significiant amount of space without you "losing"
                        anything, because you can always recompile if you want.

                    "const" is used to indicate that something will
                    not be (must not be) changed. It can get a bit murky, but
                    the idea is fairly simple:<br>

                    <div class="code">x = y;</div>
                    You expect the above line to change x, but not y. The
                    assignment operator for whatever the type of x and y are
                    should not modify the right hand side object.
                    <br><br>The copy constructor is similar: you expect it
                    to initialize the new object, but not to change the existing
                    object<br>
                    <div class="code">
                        DogHouse fluffy(snoopy); <br>// same as DogHouse
                        fluffy = snoopy;
                    </div>
                    should not change snoopy.<br>

                    <br>
                    While you can just abide by that rule, writing const for the
                    parameter is a written promise to the caller/client that you
                    won't change the parameter, and the compiler will make sure
                    you keep your promise.<br>
                    So, I would write const on the copy constructor's
                    parameter.<br><br>

                    Why: When you raise an exception, it immediately leaves the
                    current scope and goes up the call stack looking for a
                    catch. Unless or until if finds one, it keeps leaving
                    functions. If the program terminates, destructors will not
                    have been run, and you not have recycled all memory. This
                    makes sense, because the existence of an exception renders
                    it questionable whether it is safe to run the destructors.

                    You need to test that your code throws exceptions when
                    appropriate.<br><br> The question has arisen: are you required to
                    catch exceptions?<br />
                    No. You have two choices for testing cases that throw
                    exceptions:<br />
                    Write a test that generates the exception, and let your test
                    program crash with an unhandled exception. Verify that the
                    message is correct (it will print out). Then, you can
                    comment that test out in testCharArrayList.cpp and put a
                    note in the comments that the test ran as expected and
                    passed (assuming that's true --- if not, describe the
                    issue).<br />
                    <br />
                    Write a test that generates and then catches the exception,
                    inspects the message, and prints out a success or failure
                    message as appropriate. This is how our test code will
                    work.<br />
                    <br />
                    There is no penalty for taking strategy 1 --- either way is
                    fine. The important part here is not whether yo

                    with knowledge of the implementation: you want to
                    specifically test normal, edge, and error cases. That means

                    <br />
                    In this case, you have two choices that are both
                    acceptable:<br /><br>
                    -&nbsp;You can let the test case(s) crash the program. If they do
                    so as expected, then you can comment those cases out with a
                    note that the test crashed as expected so that the rest of
                    the test program can run. This shows us how you tested the
                    corresponding requirement.<br /><br>
                    -&nbsp;You can catch the exception, verify the message, and report
                    success or failure and then allow the rest of the test
                    program to run.<br />
                    <br />
                    Again, both of these choices are fine for the test program,
                    but we do want to see that you tested the relevant cases

                    General question: When we have data that is not accessible
                    to the user, but is data that we have allocated, what do we
                    store in it?

                    As a specific question to Array List containing characters,
                    when capacity is greater than the number of characters
                    actually stored in the CharArrayList, what represents the
                    empty space? Do we use '\0' for it?

                    No. When we have data allocated, that is not going to be
                    read before its set again, we don't care about its
                    "perceived value".
                    <br><br>
                    As in, until the memory is actually initialized with some
                    value you care about, it can be pretty much anything. They
                    are just addresses in memory, so they could hold all sorts
                    of wacky values.<br>

                    <br>In fact, it's kind of a fun experiment to allocate an
                    array of some size, say 100 integers, and then print out the
                    values of them. You might be surprised by the result!

                    <br><br>
                    To answer the specific question, we do not change the values
                    in our CharArrayList to the null character, because we will
                    never read them until after they are set again (and
                    therefore do not have used value), and we keep track of that
                    using the "num items" and "capacity" private data memebers.

                    This is a very good question.<br><br>
                    Some functions may be hard to test, and, of course, Comp 15
                    does not require that students do anything that is
                    impossible.<br>
                    You have to decide what, if anything, you can do in these
                    cases. Since you implemented the functions, only you know
                    the details about what constitutes a good test (exactly what
                    boundary conditions there are, if any, what values might be
                    problematic, etc.).<br>
                    If it helps, you may temporarily create a public test
                    function in order to test some function. If you do that, you
                    must<br>
                    Make it private after your tests and before you submit,

                    <br>
                    Document that you did this in your testing documentation (in
                    your README and/or test file). You could say, "to test
                    the X function, I created a test_X function and temporarily
                    made it public and then called it with arguments Y and Z.
                    This verifies ..." Also leave the test code in place
                    that called the public function, but obviously you will need
                    to comment it out, or the program won't compile and link
                    after the function is made private.

                    More in depth answer --<br>
                    C++ references and pointers are different, though references
                    can be implemented using pointers behind the scenes with the
                    compiler doing all the addressing and dereferencing
                    automatically. <br>
                    They are different, however, for very practical reasons: the
                    compiler is free to eliminate any pointers involved in the
                    use of references if it can, but it cannot, in general,
                    eliminate pointers created by the programmer.<br>
                    A reference is a programmer-declared alias, in which a
                    variable refers directly to the memory associated with
                    another variable. (That sounds like a pointer, but compilers
                    can be very tricky and can even avoid creating variables
                    sometimes.) A pointer variable is a location in memory (a
                    variable) that can contain the address (pointer value) of

                    How to avoid calling the destructor twice?<br>
                    In my clear function, I call a helper function that deletes
                    all nodes in order to clear the LinkedList in the same way a
                    destructor would. Unfortunately, when the LinkedList then
                    goes out of scope, the destructor is called again, resulting
                    in a valgrind double free error because the program is
                    trying to clear memory that has already been cleared.<br>
                    Is there a way to bypass the calling the destructor on an
                    empty LinkedList, for example?

                    The clear function should delete all the nodes like a
                    destructor would, and writing a helper function to use in
                    both the clear function and the destructor is a good example
                    of modularity. However, there is no way to circumvent
                    calling the destructor; it's an essential part of how a
                    class functions. But, both clear() and the destructor should
                    work on an empty list, so could you potentially add a
                    condition to your helper function in the case of an empty
                    list, which would prevent trying to free an empty list?

                    No :-) Actually, it's not a bad idea, and good for you for
                    investigating, but...<br>
                    This is not a "C++ course," that is, C++ is not
                    the primary object of study. Data structures are. So, while
                    there is necessarily a lot of C++-specific stuff in the
                    course, we just can't do a complete tour of C++ features,
                    even extremely useful and common ones. I already feel that
                    the first part of the course is rather thick with C++ stuff
                    like assignment operator overloading and copy constructors,
                    but nothing will work if you don't do those.<br>
                    Iterators are great, and in a professional setting you
                    should use them, but I am prioritizing other things. Others
                    could make perfectly sensible other choices.<br>
                    I would still do interfaces with abstract classes before
                    iterators, in fact, and we may talk about that --- we did in
                    the spring as a kind of additional topic. I might suggest
                    "concepts," too, but I haven't really caught up on
                    everything (I think they are for bounded quantification of
                    generic types, and that can get much better error
                    messages.)<br>
                    Anyway, there are lots of good things, and we can't cover
                    them all, so we pick. <br>
                    (In fact, modern C++ should use smart pointers, but we don't
                    teach that, because (a) they're hard to see the value of
                    until you know the underlying stuff and what can go wrong,
                    and (b) we want students to be ready for Comp 40, which
                    assumes students are very comfortable with raw pointers and
                    can move easily to C.)

                    Sure, using cp is one way to copy files. The regular cp
                    command copies files one by one. So for example<br>
                    <div class="terminal">cp /somedirectory/somefile ./</div>

                    will make a copy of somefile located in the directory
                    /somedirectory into your current folder.<br>
                    <div class="terminal">cp /somedirectory/ * ./</div>

                    will copy all of the files in /somedirectory into the
                    current directory.<br>
                    However, if you want to copy an entire directory, which is
                    what I'm guessing you want to do, you would do<br>
                    <div class="terminal">
                        cp -r /somedirectory /path/where/you/want/the/copy
                    </div>
                    In fact, cp does a lot of other things. Try this out:<br>
                    <div class="important">man cp</div>

                    That will open the manual page for the program cp! It has
                    lots of other options that can be useful to you. In fact,
                    most commands you are used to running like ls, cd, mkdir,
                    touch, cat etc. have man pages. Just type man in front of
                    your favorite command to see all that you can do.<br>
                    In fact learning to read and understand man pages will
                    benefit you greatly! I learned this the hard way, and sort
                    of forced myself to take the time to read the documentation,
                    and it really has payed off!<br>

                    <br>
                    Also,<br>
                    If you're working directly on halligan, the halligan server
                    automatically backs up all of your files. It saves versions
                    every 4 hours (for the past 24 hours), every day (for 6 days
                    before that), and every week (for the 3 weeks before
                    that).<br>
                    You can access those backups by going to the .snapshot
                    directory in your home directory.<br>
                    <div class="terminal">cd ~/.snapshot</div>
                    There, you can browse through the various backups and copy
                    the files you need back to your working directory.

                    Then that's totally fine. Different systems have different
                    ways of displaying exceptions. The output on my mac is
                    slightly different from the ones on the halligan, and that's
                    all right. They are all standard library's way of displaying
                    and formatting an uncaught exception.<br>
                    In real life, people who are using your code are probably
                    going to
                    <div class="code">try{} catch{}</div>
                    your exception (which is where the name "uncaught
                    exceptions" comes from) so they know when they're doing
                    something wrong without crashing the application. And your
                    exception message is going to be passed onto the code that
                    "catches" your error, without the
                    "abort" or any of the formatting added.

                        follow up response. This is a good discussion, so the

                    Student answer:<br>
                    <br>
                    For overloading the "=":<br>
                    If X=Y , "=" is an assignment operation that maps the value
                    of Y to X. Returning a reference allows transitivity.

                    <br><br>
                    If you know about relations you know "=" is the most trivial
                    example of an equivalence relation. "=" allows chaining so
                    X=Y and Y=Z we can just write X=Y=Z. operator= actually
                    assigns something to the object. So if I say X=Y=Z=5 this is
                    X = (Y = (Z = 5) ). 5 is assigned to Z then return Z then Z
                    is assigned to Y return Y then assign Y to X. So to do a
                    chain you must return a reference to the LHS of the = each
                    time. Hence we return *this not this. <br><br>
                    For overloading comparison operators like "==":<br>
                    You don't need to return a reference to any object you just
                    compare and return a bool result. <br><br>
                    <br><br>

                    Follow up by instructor:<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Excellent student answer!<br><br>
                    Emphasize: in a typical assignment overload, the &amp;
                    symbol appears in 3 places. In one of those places, it's the
                    "address of" operator: (this != &amp;rhs) (or
                    similar). In this case, you are taking the address of rhs
                    and seeing if this contains that address --- if so, then you
                    are assigning an object to itself, and maybe there isn't
                    much to do in that case.<br><br>
                    In the function header, &amp; is used in the parameter and
                    return declarations to indicate those are references: it's
                    an indicator of a reference (the function takes and returns
                    a reference to an instance of the class). While under the
                    covers they may be (and often are) implemented with pointer
                    values, they are not a case where the programmer is
                    explicitly taking the address of anything.<br><br>
                    The student answer gets at exactly why the assignment
                    returns a reference: You want to be able to chain
                    assignments (C++ allows that, and if your assignment
                    doesn't, then clients will be frustrated and confused). If
                    it weren't a reference, then there could be an extra copy
                    where you assign an object, the make a copy of the assigned
                    object to return, and then each = in the chain would create
                    a copy that was immediately destroyed after the assignment.
                    So, a reference wins. Note the object whose reference you
                    return is guaranteed to exist after the overload function
                    runs, because it was already there: there had to be
                    something for this to point to. The argument is passed by
                    (const) reference to avoid making a copy.<br><br>
                    You can pass references to &lt;, &gt;, ==, but there is
                    really no point in returning a reference to a boolean, and
                    if you did, what reference would you return? You cannot
                    return a reference to a local variable on the stack (or you
                    don't want to). So, booleans are cheap to copy and you don't
                    actually have an existing boolean variable to return a
                    reference to. You can pass the arguments by reference for
                    these, and that's the normal procedure. Again, it avoids
                    making extra copies just to compare things.

                    "Illegal Instruction" errors are often caused when

                    You may remember also that assignment operators are not like
                    constructors, they must return the object its working on,
                    namely with "return *this;"<br>

                    function," that usually indicates a return call is

                    Logic: When you make a templated class, say List, there is
                    no thing of type List. It has to be List
                    &lt;...something...&gt; to fill in the template. If you know
                    the type, you can write List&lt;int&gt; or
                    List&lt;SpaceStation&gt;. If you are writing another
                    template, then the type of the list may depend on the
                    template type parameter(s).

                    Be careful! For example, setting your editor to wrap doesn't
                    necessarily mean that the lines are less than 76 or 65

                    Does the autograder care whether we use cout or cerr?<br>
                    <br>
                    I know that using &gt; to redirect output into a file
                    doesn't redirect cerr in unix, so I was wondering if the
                    autograder requires output to go to cout so it can redirect
                    it and run `diff` on the resulting file.

                    You must follow the specification in the assignment.<br>
                    <br>
                    You may use cerr for debugging purposes, but then you should
                    remove that output before you turn it in.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Redirection from the command line does not show up in the
                    program in any way (that we can detect with Comp 15
                    programs), which is the beauty of shell I/O redirection.
                    <br>
                    The autograder actually captures both standard output and
                    standard error output. If the assignment requires output to
                    cerr, we can check it, and if it does not, then there may be
                    (and usually is) a penalty for inappropriate output to
                    cerr.<br>
                    Again, this doesn't mean you should be shy about using cerr
                    for debugging purposes!

                    No errors is good, but that's a separate issue. Look at

                    Many students think that cout is a command, a verb that
                    tells the computer to do something. It is not.
                    <span class="important">&lt;&lt; </span> is the verb that
                    tells the computer to send the stuff on the right to the
                    place on the left.
                    <span class="important">
                        cout is place you can &lt;&lt; ("send",
                        "print") things.</span>
                    If you have another place, like myOutputFileStream, then you
                    can send stuff there by writing
                    <div class="code">
                        myOutputFileStream &lt;&lt; stuff_to_print;<br>
                    </div>
                    cout is not special syntax: it's just a pre-defined global
                    variable that contains an instance of an output stream
                    class, and that instance is normally tied to the console.
                    The &lt;&lt; operator will work with ANY output stream!<br><br>
                    There are several kinds of output stream. cout is an
                    ostream. If you open a file, it will be an ofstream (output
                    file stream). But a function that takes an ostream can also
                    accept an ofstream.<br><br>
                    Last note: always pass stream objects by reference (or by
                    pointer, but reference is the C++ way).<br><br>

                    As the assignment (may) says: you should make one or more
                    separate testing programs (so you can use (filename).cpp to
                    compare your output with the reference).<br>
                    In order to submit those, you will need to add those file
                    names to the provide command. If you are using make provide,
                    then you will need to add your testing file names to the
                    provide command in the Makefile.<br>
                    Recall that the provide command's usage is:<br>
                    provide course assignment file1 ...<br>
                    For us, the course is comp15, assignment is hw4, and then
                    you list all the files you want provide to copy over for the
                    grader.<br>
                    You can use man provide to learn all about it. Provide is
                    not a general Unix program, but a program written by our own
                    Prof. Alva Couch.

                    Yes, your functions can use a recursive helper function,
                    rather than being recursive themselves. Often, the
                    parameters in the public functions do not work well for
                    recursion. <br>

                    Make sure to read the spec for your specific assignment,

                    We are interested in your solution and how you (purposely)
                    tested your solution. We don't expect to see everything you
                    did to debug. Testing and debugging can be intertwined, of
                    course, but our main interest in this regard is how you
                    checked that things worked, and not so much all that
                    happened when things didn't work.<br><br>
                    If you put print statements in as part of you testing
                    strategy, and they aren't too distracting, you can leave
                    them commented out and describe the strategy in your README
                    (and explain their presence). But, even then, I would
                    probably delete them and just say you put print statements
                    in functions to ensure (whatever you want to test) But they
                    should part of a coherent testing strategy, not just normal
                    debugging.<br><br>
                    We mostly want your algorithm to stand out clearly in the
                    implementation, and lots of extraneous debug statements can
                    be distracting.

                    file, so it has it's own main function. Should these files
                    be included in the makefile? I'm just wondering because it
                    feels weird if the makefile has two main functions.

                    Makefiles can have any number of targets. That's ok.<br>
                    The first one is special, because if you type
                    "make" it will build the first target. But it's
                    quite common to have others.

                    are all fine things to type. As a rule, you should make the
                    first rule build whatever the assignment asks for.

                    Review: How to organize programs with separate components<br>
                    It is important to know that C++ allows functions to be in a
                    class or not. main, for example, is never in a class, and
                    the functions you write for the first part of Comp 11 are
                    all outside of any class.<br>
                    This is true for separate program components (called
                    modules), too. To make a separate program module you:<br>
                    Make a .h file with declarations necessary to use the
                    module. The .h file can contain class definition(s) and/or
                    function headers for top-level functions.<br>
                    <br>
                    Put the definitions of the functions in a .cpp file. If they
                    are in a class, then you put ClassName:: in front of them,
                    if not, then you don't put anything in front of the function
                    names.<br>
                    <br>
                    #include the .h file in the implementation .cpp file AND in
                    any client files. Never #include .cpp files!<br>
                    <br>
                    Compile all .cpp files to .o files<br>
                    <br>
                    Link together the .o files necessary for any particular
                    program

                    The latter is preferred.

                    <br><br>
                    However, the most important thing is readability. If
                    something is more readable, or if saying "not test" doesn't
                    really make sense, then you can use the style that makes the
                    most sense.

                    Is there a way to redirect the output of the standard error

                <td class="xl69" style="border-top: none; border-left: none; width: 1670pt" width="2227">
                    Yes. First, this is the reason that cerr and cout are
                    different streams --- so that you can separate error
                    messages from normal programming output automatically!<br>
                    You can send both cout and cerr to the same file in the tcsh
                    (the shell that student accounts get by default) like this:
                    <div class="terminal">
                        command_you_want_to_run &gt;&amp;

                        &amp;
                    </div>
                    is like &gt; except that it grabs both cout and cerr.<br>
                    Redirecting just cerr is actually strangely difficult in
                    tcsh, so post on piazza if you need help with that.

                    Because they are not something for the client nor something
                    C++ needs for the class, they should not go in the .h
                    file.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can make functions like this static (defined in the .cpp
                    file). A static function is a function that is exactly as
                    you described. You can do
                    <div class="code">
                        static bool got_int(string s, int *resultp) {<br>
                        char extra;<br>
                        return sscanf(s.c_str(), " %d %c", resultp,
                        &amp;extra) == 1;
                        <br>}
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    Make sure to define the static functions BEFORE you define
                    the functions that call them.

                    an educated guess: you're infinite looping somewhere in your

                    tldr; Since negative numbers aren't useful for indexing into
                    arrays, unsigned int values are used to index into an
                    array.<br>
                    -----------<br>
                    The
                    <div class="code">size()</div>
                    function of a vector returns a
                    <span class="important">size_t value.</span> <br>
                    <div class="code">std::size_t</div>
                    is a type used for expressing the sizes of things.<br>
                    <br>
                    A key feature of sizes is that, while they are integers,
                    they cannot be negative, so a size_t is an unsigned integer
                    of some kind ("unsigned" in C++ means values will
                    always be &gt;= 0). C++ is warning you about comparing
                    signed and unsigned values, because it's usually a case
                    where the programmer messed up, and strange things can
                    happen. For example,
                    <div class="code">
                        for (size_t i = 10; i &gt;= 0; --i)<br>
                        cout &lt;&lt; "i is " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt;
                        endl;
                    </div>
                    is an infinite loop, because i can never be negative!<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Moral: Always use unsigned integers, and specifically
                    size_t's for iterating over collections.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    If you want some more (a little Comp 40 preview!):<br>
                    An int in C++ on our system is 4 bytes. There are 32 bits in
                    4 bytes, which can encode 4,294,967,296 distinct values.
                    Integers may be positive or negative, so some of the values
                    will be for negative values and others for positive values
                    (and 0). One bit can be used as the sign. Thus, an integer
                    may be any value in the range:<br>
                    -2,147,483,648 through 2,148,483,647<br>
                    That's −2^31 through 2^31 −1 (0 takes up one of
                    the non-negative values)<br>
                    <br><br>
                    In C++, negative numbers cannot be used to index into an
                    array. Consequently, using a standard signed integer is
                    inefficient; it cannot use half of its domain. An unsigned
                    integer uses all 32 bits to represent a number (and can
                    therefore only represent positive numbers). An unsigned long
                    integer can use 64 bits! The number of bits in a size_t is
                    implementation dependent, but if you use variables of type
                    size_t, then you be sure you'll be able to represent the
                    size (and index where appropriate) of any C++ collection.

                    I encourage students to look up things they are using. This
                    is a key professional skill. For example, good getline
                    documentation can be had here: <br><br>
                    http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/getline/<br><br>
                    getline reads a line of text into a single string. That line
                    ends at the next '\n' or at the end of file, whichever comes
                    first, and '\n' is not included in the string (if it was
                    there at all). Here is exactly what it says:<br>
                    Extracts characters from is and stores them into str until
                    the delimitation character delim is found (or the newline
                    character, '\n', for (2)).<br>
                    <br>
                    The extraction also stops if the end of file is reached in
                    is or if some other error occurs during the input
                    operation.<br>
                    <br>
                    If the delimiter is found, it is extracted and discarded
                    (i.e. it is not stored and the next input operation will
                    begin after it).<br>
                    <br>
                    Note that any content in str before the call is replaced by
                    the newly extracted sequence.<br>
                    <br>
                    Each extracted character is appended to the string as if its
                    member push_back was called.<br>
                    &gt;&gt; on the other had extracts things from the stream
                    based on the type of the variable designated to receive the
                    variable. This one is trickier to look up, because sometimes
                    it's in the stream class, sometimes it's in the target
                    variable's class, and sometimes it's an external function.
                    In the case of strings
                    (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/), it's a
                    non-member function overloaded by the string library
                    (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/operator%3E%3E/)<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunatly, the documentation appeals to operator&gt;&gt;
                    on c-strings, to which it does not link, but the
                    documentation covers you:<br>
                    Notice that the istream extraction operations use
                    whitespaces as separators; Therefore, this operation will
                    only extract what can be considered a word from the stream.
                    To extract entire lines of text, see the string overload of
                    global function getline.<br>
                    so, it stops at the next (whitespace) delimiter.
                    <br>
                    A line that contains "pony frog\n" will give back
                    "pony" using &gt;&gt; but "pony frog"
                    using getline.

                    It is true that that in a graph with V vertices and E edges,
                    E∈O(V2), but not every edge is used. In a connected
                    graph, every vertex is visited exactly once by Dijkstra's
                    algorithm. This means the number of edges actually traversed
                    when running Dijkstra's algorithm is O(V).<br>
                    <br>
                    Over the course of the algorithm, V vertices are inserted
                    into the min-heap (each insertion takes O(lgV) time), and
                    there are E extractions from the min-heap (each extraction
                    also takes O(lgV) time. Thus, the runtime of the algorithm
                    is O((V+E)lgV), which expands to Θ(VlgV+ElgV). Since at
                    most V edges prompt an extraction, E∉O(V2)<br>
                    Also, consider this: it is impossible for every edge in a
                    fully connected graph to result in a path to a given vertex
                    that is shorter than every other previous path. If this were
                    the case, that would imply that every path was the shortest
                    path, which is never the case.<br>
                    -------<br>
                    Follow up Question: I still don't get it. If you have a DAG
                    or just a directed graph the number of edges still converges
                    to O(V^2)?<br>
                    -------<br>
                    If you have O(|V|^2) edges, then there is nothing you can
                    do. As I said in the video, most graphs do not have that
                    many edges: completely connected graphs are rare in
                    practice, and sparse graphs are the norm, at least for many
                    applications. <br>
                    I think the example I used in the video was a road map where
                    vertices are road intersections. There is no road from every
                    intersection to every other intersection. In fact, a typical
                    intersection will have &lt;= 4 neighbors. You can pretty
                    much assume that an intersection will have some constant
                    bounded number of intersections. I saw some estimates online
                    that there are ~300,000 intersections with traffic signals
                    in the US, but none of them have anything like 300,000 roads
                    coming into them!<br>
                    <br>
                    So, the priority queue model does assume that you are not
                    going to have O(|V|^2) edges --- in fact, must less, like
                    O(|V|), is common.

                    Zach and I were both answering this, and we had overlapping,
                    but not identical, information in the explanation and gave
                    the same suggestion :-)<br>
                    -------<br>
                    tl;dr Don't use the bitwise operator for boolean purposes.
                    If you want to force evaluation, either <br>
                    <br>●Assign the two items to variables and then put
                    the variables in the boolean expression<br>

                    <br>
                    ●Make a function that does the and/or operation, which
                    will force all arguments to be evaluated.<br>
                    <br>

                    Here is more:<br>
                    The English/symbol operator name split is not related to
                    when things are evaluated (strictness). <br>
                    <br>
                    We usually use the terms "strict" and
                    "lazy" with regard to function arguments (though
                    nearly all mainstream programming languages are strict).<br>
                    <br>
                    For boolean operators, the term we use is
                    "short-circuit." A short-circuit operator produces
                    result as soon as the answer is known, and does not evaluate
                    the second operand when it isn't necessary. Thus,
                    short-circuit operators are not just boolean operations, but
                    are also control flow operators.<br>
                    For example,
                    <div class="code">
                        orders_verified() and launch_missiles
                    </div>
                    won't launch missiles if orders have not been verified.
                    Whew! You can think of logical and/or as being built from if
                    statements (really conditional expressions).<br>
                    The English names are just more readable names for the
                    operators. For example, for each row, the operator name on
                    the left is exactly equivalent to the symbol(s) on the
                    right. The named version and the symbol version have exactly
                    the same control flow properties.

                    <br>
                    The bitwise operators are not the same as the boolean
                    operators. If you JUST have true boolean values, then they
                    will work the same, BUT C++ inherits C's history of punning
                    on booleans. That is, 0 is considered false and ANY integral
                    non-zero value is considered true. There are functions that
                    are used in a boolean context that will return non-zero true
                    values that are not true (which is convertible with 1).<br><br>
                    Suppose is_frob(a) returns a true value of 5, and is_frob(b)
                    also returns a true value, but the integer is actually
                    10.<br><br>
                    Then, is_frob(a) and is_frob(b) which is the same as the
                    old-fashioned is_frob(a) &amp;&amp; is_frob(b) will be true.
                    But, is_frob(a) bitand is_frob(b) which is the same as
                    is_frob(a) &amp; is_frob(b) will be 0, which is considered
                    false.<br><br>
                    This is why I adopted the policy in Comp 15 of using the
                    English ones: it's very easy to type &amp; when you mean
                    &amp;&amp; and not notice the difference, and it will often
                    work. Except sometimes. And then the bug is very hard to
                    figure out. You are not likely to type bitand when you mean
                    and.<br><br>
                    So, DO use the names rather than the symbols, because they
                    are easier to read AND less likely to lead to mysterious
                    bugs. DO use boolean operators when you are doing boolean
                    operations, and use bitwise operators only for actual bit
                    manipulations. This more clearly communicates your
                    intentions to the reader. (If you use bitwise operators to
                    enforce strictness, then you'll need a 2 or 3 line comment
                    explaining why you're doing it, and even then, you've sent
                    the reader down a little detour. You can assign values to
                    variables and then put a brief comment that your forcing the
                    evaluation of all boolean expressions --- but the fact that
                    we're doing boolean manipulations is clear.<br><br>
                    -Mark<br><br>
                    -------<br><br>
                    Generally, try to avoid writing (non-short-circuited)
                    boolean expressions that rely on the evaluation order of
                    each expression. The evaluation order for
                    non-short-circuited boolean operations is not guaranteed, so
                    the side effects you intend to induce may not behave as
                    expected.<br><br>
                    I would recommend you evaluate each expression and store the
                    resulting boolean in a variable. This will guarantee the
                    expressions are evaluated in the order you intend. Then,
                    just compare the booleans using the standard and keyword.<br><br>
                    Technically speaking, use of "&amp;" operator is
                    appropriate for your case (but it still not preferred).
                    Bjarne Stroustrup (the inventor of C++) really loved his
                    ampersands; there are seven different use cases for the
                    "&amp;" character in C++, each with distinct
                    behaviors. This invariably leads to confounding errors when
                    we try to debug code that looks perfect, but is sneakily
                    interpreting our ampersands in a way other than we intended.
                    The not, and, and or keywords are included in C++ for good
                    reason; to avoid all this unnecessary confusion. Thus, we
                    explicitly forbid the "&amp;&amp;" boolean
                    operator in COMP 15. --Zach
