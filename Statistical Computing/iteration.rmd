Last week: R basics
===

- We write programs by composing functions to manipulate data
- The basic data types let us represent Booleans, numbers, and characters
- Data structures let us group together related values 
- Vectors let us group values of the same type
- Arrays add multi-dimensional structure to vectors
- Matrices act like you'd hope they would
- Lists let us combine different types of data
- Data frames are hybrids of matrices and lists, allowing each column to have a different data type

<span style="color: blue">*Indexing*</span>

How R indexes vectors, matrices, lists
===

There are 3 ways to index a vector, matrix, data frame, or list in R:

1. Using explicit integer indices (or negative integers)
2. Using a Boolean vector (often created on-the-fly)
3. Using names

Note: in general, we have to set the names ourselves. Use `names()` for vectors and lists, and `rownames()`, `colnames()` for matrices and data frames

Indexing with integers
===

The most transparent way. Can index with an integer, or integer vector (or negative integer, or negative integer vector). Examples for vectors:

```{r}
set.seed(33) # For reproducibility
x.vec = rnorm(6) # Generate a vector of 6 random standard normals
x.vec
x.vec[3] # Third element
x.vec[c(3,4,5)] # Third through fifth elements
x.vec[3:5] # Same, but written more succintly
x.vec[c(3,5,4)] # Third, fifth, then fourth element
```

---

```{r}
x.vec[-3] # All but third element
x.vec[c(-3,-4,-5)] # All but third through fifth element
x.vec[-c(3,4,5)] # Same
x.vec[-(3:5)] # Same, more succint (note the parantheses!)
```

---

Examples for matrices:

```{r}
x.mat = matrix(x.vec, 3, 2) # Fill a 3 x 2 matrix with those same 6 normals,
                            # column major order
x.mat
x.mat[2,2] # Element in 2nd row, 2nd column
x.mat[5] # Same (note this is using column major order)
```

---

```{r}
x.mat[2,] # Second row
x.mat[1:2,] # First and second rows
x.mat[,1] # First column
x.mat[,-1] # All but first column 
```

---

Examples for lists:

```{r}
x.list = list(x.vec, letters, sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),size=4,replace=TRUE))
x.list
x.list[[3]] # Third element of list
x.list[3] # Third element of list, kept as a list
```

---

```{r}
x.list[1:2] # First and second elements of list (note the single brackets!)
x.list[-1] # All but first element of list
```

Note: you will get errors if you try to do either of above commands with double brackets `[[ ]]`

Indexing with booleans
===

This might appear a bit more tricky at first but is *very useful*, especially when we define a boolean vector "on-the-fly". Examples for vectors:

```{r}
x.vec[c(F,F,T,F,F,F)] # Third element
x.vec[c(T,T,F,T,T,T)] # All but third element
pos.vec = x.vec > 0 # Boolean vector indicating whether each element is positive
pos.vec
x.vec[pos.vec] # Pull out only positive elements
x.vec[x.vec > 0] # Same, but more succint (this is done "on-the-fly")
```

Works the same way for lists; in lab, we'll explore logical indexing for matrices

Indexing with names
===

Indexing with names can also be quite useful. We must have names in the first place; with vectors or lists, use `names()` to set the names

```{r}
names(x.list) = c("normals", "letters", "bools")
x.list[["letters"]] # "letters" (third) element 
x.list$letters # Same, just using different notation
x.list[c("normals","bools")]
```

- We will see indexing by names being especially useful when we talk more about data frames, shortly  
- In lab, we'll practice using `rownames()` and `colnames()` and named indexing with matrices

<span style="color: blue">*Control flow (if, else, etc.)*</span>

Control flow
===

Summary of the control flow tools in R:

- `if()`, `else if()`, `else`: standard conditionals
- `ifelse()`: conditional function that vectorizes nicely
- `switch()`: handy for deciding between several options

`if()` and `else`
===

Use `if()` and `else` to decide whether to evaluate one block of code or another, depending on a condition

```{r}
x = 0.5

if (x >= 0) {
  x
} else {
  -x
}
```

- Condition in `if()` needs to give one `TRUE` or `FALSE` value
- Note that the `else` statement is optional
- Single line actions don't need braces, i.e., could shorten above to `if (x >= 0) x else -x`

`else if()`
===

We can use `else if()` arbitrarily many times following an `if()` statement

```{r}
x = -2

if (x^2 < 1) {
  x^2 
} else if (x >= 1) {
  2*x-1
} else {
 -2*x+1
}
```

- Each `else if()` only gets considered if the conditions above it were not `TRUE`
- The `else` statement gets evaluated if none of the above conditions were `TRUE`
- Note again that the `else` statement is optional 

Quick decision making
===

In the `ifelse()` function we specify a condition, then a value if the condition holds, and a value if the condition fails

```{r}
ifelse(x > 0, x, -x)
```

One advantage of `ifelse()` is that it vectorizes nicely; we'll see this on the lab

Deciding between many options
===

Instead of an `if()` statement followed by `elseif()` statements (and perhaps a final `else`), we can use `switch()`. We pass a variable to select on, then a value for each option

```{r}
type.of.summary = "mode"

switch(type.of.summary,
       mean=mean(x.vec),
       median=median(x.vec),
       histogram=hist(x.vec),
       "I don't understand")
```

- Here we are expecting `type.of.summary` to be a string, either "mean", "median", or "histogram"; we specify what to do for each 
- The last passed argument has no name, and it serves as the `else` clause
- Try changing `type.of.summary` above and see what happens 

Reminder: Boolean operators
===

Remember our standard Boolean operators, `&` and `|`. These combine terms elementwise

```{r}
u.vec = runif(10, -1, 1)
u.vec
u.vec[-0.5 <= u.vec & u.vec <= 0.5] = 999 
u.vec
```

Lazy Boolean operators
===

In contrast to the standard Boolean operators, `&&` and `||` give just a single Boolean, "lazily": meaning we terminate evaluating the expression ASAP

```{r}
(0 > 0) && all(matrix(0,2,2) == matrix(0,3,3)) 
(0 > 0) && (ThisVariableIsNotDefined == 0) 
```

- Note R *never* evaluates the expression on the right in each line (each would throw an error)
- In control flow, we typically just want one Boolean
- Rule of thumb: use `&` and `|` for indexing or subsetting, and `&&` and `||` for conditionals

<span style="color: blue">*Iteration*</span>

Iteration
===

Computers: good at applying rigid rules over and over again. Humans: not so good at this. Iteration is at the heart of programming

Summary of the iteration methods in R:

- `for()`, `while()` loops: standard loop constructs
- Vectorization: use it whenever possible! Often faster and simpler
- The apply family of functions: alternative to `for()` loop, these are base R functions
- The map family of functions: another alternative, very useful, from the `purrr` package

`for()`
===

A `for()` loop increments a **counter** variable along a vector. It repeatedly runs a code block, called the  **body** of the loop, with the counter set at its current value, until it runs through the vector

```{r}
n = 10
log.vec = vector(length=n, mode="numeric")
for (i in 1:n) {
  log.vec[i] = log(i)
}
log.vec
```

Here `i` is the counter and the vector we are iterating over is `1:n`. The body is the code in between the braces

Breaking from the loop
===

We can **break** out of a `for()` loop early (before the counter has been iterated over the whole vector), using `break`

```{r}
n = 10
log.vec = vector(length=n, mode="numeric")
for (i in 1:n) {
  if (log(i) > 2) {
    cat("I'm outta here. I don't like numbers bigger than 2\n")
    break
  }
  log.vec[i] = log(i)
}
log.vec
```

Variations on standard `for()` loops
===

Many different variations on standard `for()` are possible. Two common ones:

- Nonnumeric counters: counter variable always gets iterated over a vector, but it doesn't have to be numeric
- Nested loops: body of the `for()` loop can contain another `for()` loop (or several others)

```{r}
for (str in c("Prof", "Ryan", "Tibs")) {
  cat(paste(str, "declined to comment\n"))
}

for (i in 1:4) {
  for (j in 1:i^2) {
    cat(paste(j,""))
  }
  cat("\n")
}
```

`while()`
===

A `while()` loop repeatedly runs a code block, again called the **body**, until some condition is no longer true

```{r}
i = 1
log.vec = c()
while (log(i) <= 2) {
  log.vec = c(log.vec, log(i))
  i = i+1
}
log.vec
```

`for()` versus `while()`
===

- `for()` is better when the number of times to repeat (values to iterate over) is clear in advance

- `while()` is better when you can recognize when to stop once you're there, even if you can't guess it to begin with

- `while()` is more general, in that every `for()` could be replaced with a `while()` (but not vice versa)

`while(TRUE)` or `repeat`
===

`while(TRUE)` and `repeat`: both do the same thing, just repeat the body indefinitely, until something causes the flow to break. Example (try running in your console):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
repeat {
  ans = readline("Who is the best Professor of Statistics at CMU? ")
  if (ans == "Tibs" || ans == "Tibshirani" || ans == "Ryan") {
    cat("Yes! You get an 'A'.")
    break
  }
  else {
    cat("Wrong answer!\n")
  } 
}
```

Avoiding explicit iteration
===

- Warning: some people have a tendency to **overuse** `for()` and `while()` loops in R
- They aren't always needed. Remember vectorization should be used whenever possible
- We'll emphasize this on the lab, and try to hit upon it throughout the course

Summary
===

- Three ways to index vectors, matrices, data frames, lists: integers, Booleans, names
- Boolean on-the-fly indexing can be very useful
- Named indexing will be especially useful for data frames
- Indexing lists can be a bit tricky (beware of the difference between `[ ]` and `[[ ]]`)
- `if()`, `elseif()`, `else`: standard conditionals
- `ifelse()`: shortcut for using `if()` and `else` in combination
- `switch()`: shortcut for using `if()`, `elseif()`, and `else` in combination
- `for()`, `while()`, `repeat`: standard loop constructs
- Don't overuse explicit `for()` loops, vectorization is your friend!
- `apply()` and `**ply()`: can also be very useful (we'll see them later)
